Marvel Character Full-Stack Application

For this project, I created a frontend application using React that connects to the backend using SQL Workbench. The pages included on this applicatiom are a home page, 404 page, characters page, individual character pages and 2 forms to create and update characters. There is a React Bootstrap NavBar than can be used to easily navigate between pages. Axios is used to fetch the database callouts in order for the application to function properly. The three main functions of this application are create a character, edit individual character and delete individual characters. Forms are used to create and edit characters. The forms include many React Bootstrap components and deliver error and loading messages when necessary.
